9. Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 
Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

Interview Answer ~

"I first handle edge cases: negative numbers and numbers ending with zero (except zero itself) cannot be palindromes.
Then I reverse only the second half of the number instead of the entire number.
Once the reversed half becomes greater than or equal to the remaining half, I compare them.
For odd-length numbers, I discard the middle digit using reversedHalf / 10.
This avoids extra space and potential overflow while achieving O(log n) time and O(1) space."
